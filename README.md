# Diabetes Detection Project

This project is designed to analyze and predict diabetes using the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**.  
The code is written in Jupyter Notebook and includes the following steps:

- Load the dataset
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation heatmap visualization
- Train a Linear Regression model
- Evaluate the model and calculate accuracy

## How to Run
To run this project, first install the required libraries and then open the notebook:
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook Diabetes.ipynb

## Dataset
The dataset used is the [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).  
If the file `diabetes.csv` is not included, you can download it from the link above.

## Results
- Feature correlation heatmap
- Model performance metrics
- Accuracy of diabetes prediction

Below are sample outputs from the analysis:
